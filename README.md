# Perlin-Noise-in-Hyperbolic-Space

  Generates terrain maps on Poincar√© disks using Perlin noise. Because one cannot tile hyperbolic space with a normal square grid, random values are instead generated at intervals of distance from origin and angle from +x axis.
  
  
  There is no executable jar file in this repository because users will need to change the folder on line 154 to the address where they want to store their finished images. Examples of the program's output are in the zipped folder labeled "examples."
